# Baseline (drivaerml-long-20260504)

Wave: DrivAerML long-run single-model DDP8 validation, started 2026-05-04. Branch was cut from `main`. No experiments have merged into this branch yet, so no in-wave single-model SOTA has been established here.

This file tracks the **single-model** scoreboard for this wave only. Ensemble-tier results (e.g. `18oalu1h`) are background context, not training targets — see `program.md` and `instructions/prompt-advisor.md`.

## Public reference targets to beat (AB-UPT, lower is better)

| Target | This repo metric | AB-UPT |
|--------|------------------|-----:|
| Surface pressure `p_s` | `test_primary/surface_pressure_rel_l2_pct` | 3.82 |
| Vector wall shear `tau` | `test_primary/wall_shear_rel_l2_pct` | 7.29 |
| Volume pressure `p_v` | `test_primary/volume_pressure_rel_l2_pct` | 6.08 |
| Wall shear `tau_x` | `test_primary/wall_shear_x_rel_l2_pct` | 5.35 |
| Wall shear `tau_y` | `test_primary/wall_shear_y_rel_l2_pct` | 3.65 |
| Wall shear `tau_z` | `test_primary/wall_shear_z_rel_l2_pct` | 3.63 |

## Pre-wave reference single-model evidence (background, not on this branch)

These W&B runs are the strongest verified single-model points from earlier branches and motivate this wave's hypotheses. They are **not** merged baselines on `drivaerml-long-20260504`; treat them as targets to validate under controlled long DDP8.

## Provenance policy

Run IDs and explicit configs are stronger evidence than PR merge state. The map flagged that PR #488's reported idea (`ki2q9ko9` multi-sigma STRING) was real as a W&B run but the merged code drifted; multi-sigma STRING was only fully present after #511/#516. Students and the advisor must verify that copied code actually implements the run config before claiming a replication win.

## Update protocol

When a wave PR merges with terminal `SENPAI-RESULT` and lower `test_primary/abupt_axis_mean_rel_l2_pct` than the in-wave best, append a new line to the table below and bump the "Current single-model best" pointer.

### In-wave merged single-model results

(none yet — wave just started)

### Current single-model best on `drivaerml-long-20260504`

(none — pre-wave references above are external evidence only)
