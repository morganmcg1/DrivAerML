## Most recent direction from human researcher team

Human launch directive 2026-05-04 (verbatim in `instructions/prompt-advisor.md`):

> Validate promising short-run/censored single-model mechanisms under controlled long DDP8 budgets (up to 24h, 8 GPUs each). Single-model only — no ensembles, model soups, NNLS aggregation. Report **test** metrics; validation is for steering. Each long run must be preceded by a DDP8 smoke that exercises init, dataset, W&B, checkpoint save/resume, gradient logging, and final test harvest.

Highest-priority single-model levers per the directive (with W&B references):
1. Mild static channel-aware tau weights (`9mm3sz7x` y=1.2/z=1.3, lr 9e-5).
2. Stronger bounded tau weights (`nh96x7m4` y=1.5/z=2.0).
3. EMA-proxy GradNorm with explicit volume guards (`wyz68o8r` α=0.5, `glir84cj` α=0.75, `341czkol` α=1.0).
4. Surface-loss weight 2.0 (`qqtdnlwq`).
5. Extended cosine + validation budget control (`5o7jc7wi` T_max=13).
6. Multi-sigma STRING log-frequency init (`ki2q9ko9`) — best volume.
7. Volume-point curriculum 16k→65k (`r5rw40rn`) — censored before final stages.
8. Per-axis output scaling (`wgvvevb9`).
9. STRING+QK norm (`tkiigfmc`), STRING+volume MLP (`8x7c537j`), 5L STRING (`70lnb3dt`), original STRING/GRAPE (`gcwx9yaa`).

## Current research focus (this wave)

- The four idle students each get one **distinct mechanism family** under the same long DDP8 protocol. We avoid composition tests until the components have been individually validated on this branch.
- Required operational discipline: every assignment includes a DDP8 smoke gate before the long run, an explicit volume-guard check on test metrics, and a `SENPAI-RESULT` marker built from `test_primary/*`.
- All four arms target the same test-metric reporting contract: aggregate test, surface, volume, wall, tau_x, tau_y, tau_z, runtime, slope-still-improving flag, checkpoint selection rule, and smoke-pass status.

### Round-1 assignment matrix

| Student | Mechanism family | Reference run | Source for code | Why now |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| dl24-fern | Mild static channel-aware tau weighting + lr 9e-5 | `9mm3sz7x` | `main` + small loss-weight extension | Strongest verified single-model SOTA; cleanest implementation; biggest expected win-per-line. |
| dl24-frieren | Multi-sigma STRING log-frequency init | `ki2q9ko9` | fetch `alphonse/multi-sigma-string-init` (or equivalent on `yi`/`tay`/`bengio`) | Best historical volume-pressure point; `program.md` warns of provenance drift, must verify code matches run config. |
| dl24-nezuko | Volume-point curriculum 16k→32k→49k→65k | `r5rw40rn` (censored) | curriculum scheduler over `--train-volume-points`, baseline trunk | The reference run timed out before the larger stages; 24h DDP8 should let it complete. **Deviation approved 2026-05-04:** using Lion optimizer (matches ref config); schedule adjusted to `4:16000,6:32000,10:49000,24:65000` (44 epochs) to fit 24h budget with 65k stage at 36% of steps. |
| dl24-tanjiro | Stronger bounded tau weights tau_y×1.5 / tau_z×2.0 | `nh96x7m4` | `main` flags only: `--tau-y-loss-weight 1.5 --tau-z-loss-weight 2.0` | PR #601 (EMA-proxy GradNorm) was CLOSED after catastrophic underperformance. Replacement: item #2 on the human directive's priority lever list. Stronger tau upweighting vs fern's mild (1.2/1.3) tests whether gradient budget reallocation to the cross-flow channels improves their 2.3–2.6× AB-UPT gap. **PR #623 dispatched 2026-05-04.** |

This four-arm split tests static weighting (mild on fern, stronger on tanjiro), representation init (frieren STRING), and data curriculum (nezuko).

**Wave-level SOTA so far:** frieren run `sogus8sx` (PR #599, STRING multi-sigma PE) val_abupt = **6.5281%** (step 153,831, EP14) — new single-model best in this wave, deepening SOTA breach from prior 6.582%. Run at EP~15.7/50 (step 170,703) as of 2026-05-05 00:30 UTC, continuing to EP50.

## Potential next research directions

**Active PR status (2026-05-04 22:00 UTC):**
- PR #599 (frieren) — STRING multi-sigma PE, run `sogus8sx` at EP~15.7/50 (step 170,703, latest val=6.5693%). Best checkpoint: step 153,831, val=**6.5281%**. SOTA gate breached (gate=6.7644%); vol=3.82%. Test harvest + terminal SENPAI-RESULT pending at EP50 completion.
- PR #608 (nezuko) — volume-loss ×2.0, run `y301z78k` at EP~20.4/50 (step 221,610, val=14.46%, vol=6.99%). EP20 vol gate (vol ≤ 6.9%) was borderline miss (6.9885% at step 217,319); advisor approved continuation with revised gate at **EP25 (vol ≤ 6.85%)**. Not an aggregate SOTA candidate (wall_shear~17%) but valid volume mechanism readout.
- PR #611 (fern) — tau mild y=1.2/z=1.3 AdamW, run `ug6c3nks` at EP~15.7/50 (step 170,067, val=12.370%, vol=6.42%). Slope still improving. EP20 gate (val > 15% → kill), EP30 gate (val < 11% → EP50; val > 12.5% → kill).
- PR #623 (tanjiro) — tau strong y=1.5/z=2.0. Smoke run `b7pbsdx7` at step 16,446 (EP~1.5, epochs=3). **EP1 PASS** (step 10,865, val=25.996% < 40% threshold). Awaiting EP2 and EP3 vals; if both pass, advisor authorizes full 50-epoch long run.

When the round-1 results land, the candidate next moves are (in priority order):

1. **Compose the round-1 winner with the second-best mechanism** under the same controlled long DDP8 budget — but only after at least two of the four arms produce clean terminal test results.
2. **STRING follow-ups:** STRING + QK norm (`tkiigfmc`), STRING + volume MLP (`8x7c537j`), 5L STRING (`70lnb3dt`), per-axis output scaling on STRING (`wgvvevb9`).
3. **Tau-y/tau-z bottleneck attack:** soft cross-flow geometry features (curvature via k-NN PCA, cross-flow exposure, multi-scale radius pooling) on top of the round-1 winner. Map evidence: `tau_y`/`tau_z` are 2.3-2.6× target on every single-model frontier point; representation/feature changes have moved the bottleneck more than scalar weighting.
4. **Volume-pressure generalization:** the gap between val-volume and test-volume on `9mm3sz7x` (4.14 vs 12.05) suggests held-out geometry/outlier structure rather than capacity; bucket the test set by SDF/distance-to-surface and curvature once the round-1 winner is selected.
5. **Channel-specific gradient instrumentation:** add per-channel surface_out gradient norms for surface_p, tau_x, tau_y, tau_z so the next reweighting wave can be guided by allocation, not endpoint metrics.
6. **Stronger lever combinations to consider only after individual confirmation:** mild tau weights + multi-sigma STRING; mild tau weights + extended cosine; volume curriculum + per-axis output scaling.

Items 1-2 are strict next round; items 3-6 are deeper-stack moves.

## Operational notes

- Source provenance is the central risk this wave. Students copying code from `yi`, `tay`, `bengio`, or `alphonse/*` branches must cite the source SHA and verify the copied implementation matches the W&B run config it claims to replicate.
- All runs must use DDP8 (8 GPUs per student); no single-GPU or split arms in this wave.
- Test metric harvest must reload from the best validation checkpoint, not the terminal epoch, when feasible.
- **Bug-fix merged 2026-05-04 (PR #643):** `train.py` defaults corrected to match every healthy long DDP8 reference run: `train_surface_points=65_536`, `train_volume_points=16_384`, `compile_model=False`. This is now the baseline default for all future experiment commands that omit these flags.
