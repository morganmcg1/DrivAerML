## PRIMARY RESEARCH DIRECTIVE (Issue #1056, 2026-05-12, ongoing)

**Beat Wall Shear Stress SOTA from Transolver-3 (5.85%) while not degrading vol_p or surface pressure.**

- **WSS target:** `test_WSS` < **5.85%**
- **Non-negotiable constraints:** `test_vol_p` ≤ 3.643% AND `test_SP` ≤ 3.577% (PR #972 levels)
- **Baseline for all new single-model runs:** PR #972 SDF-stratified stack

**WSS Gap (post-PR #1102):**
- Single-model best: **6.727%** (PR #972) → need −0.88pp
- Ensemble best (compliant): **6.3263%** (PR #1102 K=8 Caruana) → need **−0.476pp**

Most recent human check-in: 2026-05-14 14:17 UTC — **"NO MORE ENSEMBLES! Its the lazy route to better results, we want genuine breakthroughs, not incremental improvements based on ensembling which we know we can deploy at any point to improve results."** (Issue #1056 comment from morganmcg1). Ensemble experiments are BANNED until explicitly unlocked. Status updates posted at ~12:35 UTC and ~15:00 UTC.

## CORRECTED DATASET IN EFFECT (since 2026-05-11)

Issue #1053 (deployed 2026-05-11) fixed a case-split/indexing bug that eliminated an artificial ~3× vol_p OOD gap.

**Corrected dataset path:** `/mnt/new-pvc/Processed/drivaerml_processed_rawcanon_20260511`
**Split:** val=34 cases/7295 views, test=50 cases/11091 views

All new runs MUST use the corrected dataset path and `--data-root` flag (not `--data-path`).

## Current Best Results (Corrected Split)

### **Ensemble SOTA (PR #1102 — K=8 Caruana with-replacement, WSS-optimised)**
- val_abupt = **5.7452%** | test_abupt = **5.5196%**
- val_vol_p = 3.4360% | test_vol_p = 3.5397%  ← satisfies ≤ 3.643%
- val_WSS = 6.5195% | **test_WSS = 6.3263%**  ← TRUE WIN
- val_SP = 3.7234% | test_SP = 3.3529%  ← satisfies ≤ 3.577%
- test_tau_x = 5.6071% | test_tau_y = 6.8397% | **test_tau_z = 8.2585%** (still worst axis)
- W&B: `bq1gaewq` (Arm D greedy), `ems8ekee`, `s7pirpr1`, `qf1lqwz0`
- **Members:** `56bcqp3m`×3, `29nohj67`×2, `a0yoxy85`×2, `ghh0s4ne`×1
- **Effective weights:** {56bcqp3m:0.375, 29nohj67:0.250, a0yoxy85:0.250, ghh0s4ne:0.125}

### Prior Ensemble SOTA (PR #1064 K=3 greedy, superseded by #1102)
- val_abupt = 5.7758% | test_abupt = 5.5199% | test_WSS = 6.3712%

### Single-Model SOTA (PR #972 — SDF-stratified vol importance sampling)
- val_abupt = 6.126% | test_abupt = 5.844%
- val_vol_p = 3.798% | test_vol_p = 3.643%  ← constraint boundary
- test_SP = 3.577%  ← constraint boundary
- test_WSS = 6.727%
- W&B: source=`56bcqp3m`, eval=`zxnhtagj`

### Rank 2 Single-Model (PR #968 — Stochastic vol subsampling)
- val_abupt = 6.278% | test_abupt = 5.986% | test_WSS = 6.825%
- W&B: source=`a0yoxy85`, eval=`qbg9pkmx`

---

## Gate Criteria

### Single-Model EP3 Gates (current tay stack — no SDF importance sampling)
- **PASS:** val_abupt ≤ **7.2%** AND val_vol_p ≤ 4.5%
- **MARGINAL:** val_abupt ≤ 7.6% AND val_vol_p ≤ 5.0%
- **KILL:** otherwise

(Historical PR #972 SDF stack gates were ≤ 6.2% / ≤ 6.5% — those reflect SDF-stratified sampling that is NOT on tay; do not apply to current single-model runs.)

### WSS-Targeted Single-Model Win Criteria (becomes new pool member)
- test_WSS ≤ 6.50% AND test_vol_p ≤ 3.643% AND test_SP ≤ 3.577% AND val_abupt ≤ 6.20%

### Ensemble Win Criteria (true new SOTA after PR #1102)
- val_abupt < **5.7452%** AND test_vol_p ≤ **3.643%** AND test_WSS < **6.3263%**

## Current Research Focus and Themes

### Primary: WSS Magnitude Bottleneck Attack (Wave 28 onwards — single-model only)

**New mechanism finding from PR #1097 close (tanjiro, WSS direction loss NEGATIVE):**
- WSS **direction is essentially solved** — cos_sim stabilises at 0.996 (~5° angular error) by EP2.
- **91–96% of remaining WSS residual is magnitude error.**
- This pivots the campaign from "direction-aware" experiments (which #1094, #1096, #1097 all targeted) toward **magnitude-targeted** mechanisms (rel_l2 loss, magnitude penalty) and **frame-equivariance** (in-plane rotation aug).

### Pool Saturation — CONFIRMED (PR #1103 closed 2026-05-14 13:30Z)

The current 4-member candidate pool {`56bcqp3m`, `29nohj67`, `a0yoxy85`, `ghh0s4ne`} is Pareto-saturated under convex combinations:
- PR #1102 K=8 Caruana (MERGED) — near-globally-optimal at discrete 1/8 grid
- PR #1099 K=3 WSS-targeted (CLOSED) — converged to identical K=3 subset as #1064
- PR #1103 SLSQP continuous optimisation (CLOSED) — confirmed K=8 within ~0.03 L1 of global continuous optimum; best-case val_WSS improvement = 0.0039pp (0.06% relative); val_SP ≤ 3.577% **infeasible** on this pool (simplex floor ~3.72%, every member ≥ 3.98%)

**Active lever for ensemble gains:**
1. **Pool extension via new single-model members** — only remaining path (ensembles BANNED per human directive)

⚠️ **ENSEMBLES BANNED** — Per morganmcg1 Issue #1056 directive 2026-05-14 14:17Z: no new ensemble experiments until explicitly unlocked. PR #1108 (bias-corrected ensemble) was superseded by PR #1109 (τ_z focal loss) before training started; #1108 is effectively dead.

### Wave 28 — launched 2026-05-14 ~15:00Z–15:45Z, all 5 alive as of 17:50Z
| PR | Student | Hypothesis | Status |
|----|---------|------------|--------|
| **#1110** | askeladd | **OHEM surface top-20% mining** — supplementary loss `L += 0.5 × L_hard_top20pct`; 2-ep warmup | Running W&B `iqrc2o0s` (started 15:51Z); pre-EP1 |
| **#1111** | fern | **GradNorm + vol-curriculum (curriculum-compatible)** — adaptive task balancing with schedule intact; freeze-guard at EP3/EP6/EP9; `--use-gradnorm --gradnorm-alpha 0.12` | Running W&B `jkhnq2zd` (started 15:58Z); pre-EP1 |

## Wave 27 Closures (2026-05-14 ~13:45Z) — CATASTROPHIC FAILURE

All 4 experiments failed at EP3 with val_abupt 27–32% (4× above EP3 KILL gate of 7.6%). Root causes:

| PR | Student | val_abupt@EP3 | Root Cause |
|----|---------|---------------|------------|
| #1104 | fern | ~27% | L1 magnitude penalty `|‖τ‖−‖τ_gt‖|` creates conflicting gradients vs MSE loss; loss scale mismatch blows up training |
| #1105 | tanjiro | ~30% | Relative L2 `(pred-gt)²/‖gt‖²` numerically explodes when GT~0; near-zero WSS regions produce infinite loss |
| #1106 | frieren | ~28% | Physical-coordinate normal-frame rotation corrupts geometry signal — coordinate transformation invalidates learned features |
| #1107 | nezuko | ~32% | Yaw augmentation destroys physical orientation; model cannot learn orientation-dependent aerodynamics |

Common diagnosis: Wave 27 hypotheses all modified the **loss function or input transformation** at a fundamental level without sufficient numerical safeguards. The supplementary-loss OHEM approach (Wave 28) is designed to avoid these failure modes by adding a *supplementary* term (not replacing the base loss) with warmup and floor guards.

## Wave 26 Additional Kill (2026-05-14)

| PR | Student | Result | Key Mechanism Finding |
|----|---------|--------|----------------------|
| #1081 | askeladd | KILL @ EP10 (val_abupt=7.97%) | slw=3.0 surface loss weight — too aggressive; distorts vol_p head; baseline slw=2.0 is optimal |

## Wave 26 Closures (2026-05-13 → 2026-05-14)

| PR | Student | Result | Key Mechanism Finding |
|----|---------|--------|----------------------|
| #1094 | frieren | KILL @ EP3 (val_abupt=7.465%) | Normal-frame supervision built in normalised space — non-orthonormal |
| #1095 | nezuko | NEGATIVE (test_WSS=7.761% +1.03pp) | GradNorm mechanism healthy but starved vol head; curriculum is load-bearing |
| #1096 | edward | NEGATIVE (test_WSS +0.261pp vs ref) | Tangent-frame features redundant with normals; z-hat fallback discontinuity |
| #1097 | tanjiro | NEGATIVE (val_abupt=6.847% > KILL) | Direction NOT the bottleneck (cos_sim=0.996) |
| #1099 | fern | CONVERGED (same K=3 as #1064) | WSS-targeted greedy on 4-member pool converges to identical subset |
| #1102 | fern | **MERGED — new ensemble SOTA** | K=8 Caruana extracts ghh0s4ne WSS signal at 12.5% weight; NOW BANNED FROM EXTENSION per human directive |

## Baseline Training Recipe (current tay stack — NOT PR #972 SDF stack)

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** the PR #972 SDF-stratified vol sampling code (`--sdf-importance-sampling --sdf-alpha 4.0`) was **never merged into tay**. Do NOT include those flags in any assignment — `argparse` will reject them. The live tay baseline is the stack below (no SDF importance sampling). Single-model EP3 on this baseline lands ~6.7–6.9% val_abupt, not the historical PR #972 6.2%. Gates must be recalibrated accordingly: PASS ≤ 7.2%, MARGINAL ≤ 7.6%, KILL otherwise.

The PR #972 single-model SOTA W&B run `56bcqp3m` was trained with SDF-stratified sampling on a different branch (`dl24-frieren/vol-test-domain-augmentation`, commit `291efd2`); that code never landed on tay. Until it does, all new single-model runs are evaluated relative to the no-SDF tay baseline (thorfinn #1100 EP3=6.768% is a representative live trajectory).

## Next-Wave Hypothesis Queue

Wave 28 is FULLY IN FLIGHT (PRs #1110–#1114, all 5 students). All 5 Wave 28 ideas have been assigned. Remaining queue for Wave 29:

1. ~~**OHEM hard-example mining for high-WSS regions**~~ — **IN FLIGHT as PR #1110** (askeladd, Wave 28)
2. ~~**GradNorm + curriculum + freeze-on-transitions**~~ — **IN FLIGHT as PR #1111** (fern, Wave 28)
3. ~~**WSS magnitude + direction decomposition heads**~~ — **IN FLIGHT as PR #1112** (frieren, Wave 28)
4. ~~**SDF-stratified SURFACE sampling**~~ — **IN FLIGHT as PR #1113** (nezuko, Wave 28)
5. ~~**Learnable WSS channel loss weights**~~ — **IN FLIGHT as PR #1114** (tanjiro, Wave 28)
6. **Multi-scale surface attention** — second surface encoder at 0.5× token density to capture macro-flow features.
7. **WSS-loss-aware EMA half-life** — vary `--ema-decay` so EMA captures late-training WSS-specialised weights better.
8. **Heteroscedastic WSS loss** — model both mean and variance per surface point; downweight high-aleatoric regions.
9. **τ_z frequency analysis** — Fourier decompose tau_z predictions vs GT to find spatial frequency bands where error is concentrated; use to motivate loss or architecture changes.

⚠️ Hypotheses #6-#8 from Wave 27 are **permanently retired** (yaw aug, magnitude penalty, rel_l2, normal-frame rotation all demonstrated catastrophic failure). Do not reassign.

## Key Findings to Date

- **WSS error is magnitude-dominated** (91–96% of residual, not direction) — pivot away from direction-aware experiments
- **tau_z (spanwise) still worst axis** (test_tau_z=8.2585% on PR #1102) — primary remaining target
- **Wave 27 catastrophic lesson**: NEVER replace base MSE loss — always use supplementary/additive formulations; loss scale mismatches and numerical instability (div-by-near-zero) destroy training even at 27–32% val_abupt; Wave 28 OHEM designed as additive supplement with 2-ep warmup to avoid this
- **Relative L2 loss is unstable** (PR #1105) — near-zero GT WSS regions produce unbounded loss; avoid any loss form with GT in denominator without explicit safeguards
- **slw=3.0 surface weight too aggressive** (PR #1081 killed) — baseline slw=2.0 is optimal
- **ENSEMBLES BANNED** (human directive 2026-05-14 14:17Z) — all new work must improve the single-model SOTA
- **Corrected dataset** (2026-05-11) eliminated artificial ~3× vol_p OOD gap — biggest research-program insight
- **SDF-stratified vol importance sampling** (PR #972) is single-model SOTA: val_abupt=6.126%, test_WSS=6.727%
- **Ensemble SOTA** (PR #1102 K=8 Caruana) test_WSS=6.3263% — first compliant ensemble below 6.33%
- **4-pool Pareto-saturated** (PR #1103 CONFIRMED) — K=8 within 0.03 L1 of global continuous optimum; val_SP ≤ 3.577% infeasible on this pool (simplex floor ~3.72%); new pool members are the operative lever
- ~~**Bias-corrected ensemble** (PR #1108)~~ — closed (superseded by τ_z focal loss #1109; ensemble research BANNED)
- **Training-time vol sampling** matters more than loss weighting or architecture depth for vol_p
- **Throughput regression risk on data-pipeline experiments** (nezuko #1113 self-diagnosed 12× slowdown from 20s/case curvature compute serialised through 4 workers; fix = precompute-and-cache; advisor must spec precompute step in any future data-pipeline assignment)
- **Initial-state debug crash** (tanjiro #1114 val_abupt=65.34% on 1-ep debug, then 8-rank DDP retry also crashed) — root cause likely learnable-weight unbounded growth; mitigated by lr=1e-3 separate group + L2 reg 1e-4 + 2-ep warmup option
- **Post-xattn capacity additions** 0-for-3 (PRs #884, #891, #906) — do not add layers after surf→vol xattn
- **Rotation aug** (PR #925): aggressive yaw+pitch degrades; mild yaw-only (≤45°) being tested in PR #1107
- **Normal-frame WSS in normalised space** fails (PR #1094); physical-frame variant (#1106) is the corrected attempt
- **Tangent-frame features** redundant with surface normals (PR #1096) — model already has the information
- **Direction loss** redundant with weighted MSE (PR #1097) — cos_sim=0.996 by EP2 without it
- **GradNorm + fixed-65k vol** fails because vol curriculum is load-bearing (PR #1095)
- **Infra:** `--data-root` (not `--data-path`); mount point `/mnt/new-pvc/` (not `/mnt/pvc/`)
- **EMA lag:** `eval_raw_vs_ema=False` means only EMA weights evaluated — early-epoch EMA metrics appear worse than raw
