# SENPAI Research Results — DrivAerML (`tay`)

W&B project: `wandb-applied-ai-team/senpai-v1-drivaerml-ddp8`.

Targets to beat (lower is better, AB-UPT public reference):
`surface_pressure 3.82`, `wall_shear 7.29`, `volume_pressure 6.08`,
`tau_x 5.35`, `tau_y 3.65`, `tau_z 3.63`.

## Round 1 — opened 2026-04-29

8 students assigned in parallel on DDP8 (8 GPUs each, 96 GB VRAM, effective
bs scales with `nproc_per_node × per-GPU bs`). Strategy: 5 students compose
yi's confirmed-orthogonal wins (width × FiLM × cosine-EMA × Fourier × LR
warmup); 3 students push beyond yi with architectural / loss / TTA changes
that yi only got as far as Round-2 assignments for.

| PR | Student | Hypothesis |

| #31 | askeladd | Full composition stack: 512d × cosine-EMA × tangential × vol_w=2.0 |
| #32 | edward | Cosine LR + 5% warmup on top of 512d composition |
| #33 | fern | Gaussian Fourier coord features + 512d composition |
| #34 | frieren | AdaLN-zero per-block FiLM + 512d composition |

## Round 1 — in-progress observations (2026-04-29 12:35 UTC)

All 8 still WIP. No PRs marked review-ready. Per-axis val curves are
informative even before completion:

**Key in-progress signals** (caveat: not at completion, only first 4
validations; ranking may shift by epoch ~10):

1. **alphonse calibration matches yi epoch-1 (26.24) within 5%** —
   confirms tay/DDP8 baseline is healthy; yi's wins should reproduce.
2. **askeladd's composition stack is BEST on `ps`/`pv` but WORST on `ws`**
   — `ps=19.0` vs alphonse's 20.0, `pv=14.5` vs alphonse's 15.9, but
   `ws=46.7` vs alphonse's 30.9. The tangential wall-shear projection
   loss is net-negative for raw wall_shear despite improving the other
   axes. **Important Round 2 implication**: do NOT bundle the tangential
   projection into "compose all yi wins" runs — it hurts the metric it
   was designed to help.
3. **fern's RFF features show strong lift** — at the same step (8165)
   fern is at 30.1 vs alphonse 35.1 → RFF is doing real work. Will see
   how it compounds at later validations.
4. **edward's cosine warmup catches up rapidly** — at step 10887, edward
   is 35.68 vs alphonse's 27.74; warmup arm typically lags early then
   converges. Worth running to completion to see if it surpasses
   alphonse asymptotically.
5. **nezuko ANP decoder is dramatically slower per step** — same wall
   time produces ~4x fewer steps than alphonse. At step 4316 only 1
   validation (val=76.4). May not finish enough epochs to be comparable.
6. **tanjiro 4 crashes at exactly step 2719** — deterministic failure in
   eval path. Posted advisor comment with simplified-σ guidance.
